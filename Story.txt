"In Berlin, I enjoyed a Bratwurst at a quaint Biergarten near the bustling Hauptstrasse."
"Mehlhase went to a wettbewerbsfaehig brot eating festival"
"The Hund baked Brot and Gebaeck in the Berlin Flughafen."
"My Klimaanlage went out, I am totally screwed!"
"I was cruising in my Porsche next to a BMW when all of a sudden I spun out and crashed."
"At the Ratskeller, we savored traditional Apfelkuchen while admiring the view of Schloss Eltz."
"I had my Lederhose stolen at the Flughafen by a Katze."
"Mehlhase wore lederhosen while eating a Bratwurst on Hauptstrasse"
"While waiting for the ambulance to come, I decided to crack open a freshly wrapped up Apfelkuchen."
"I must get to the Flughafen!"
"While at the Flughafen, the Hund, donned in a Dirndel, surprised everyone by showcasing its Brot-baking skills, creating a unique Biergarten experience for travelers waiting for their flights."
"Now myself, Alex Witt, being a man of the Bratwurst eating culture, loved this Biergarten experience. I had to fight urges to miss my Flug at the Flughafen as I wanted to start my very own wettbewerbsfaehig Bratwurst eating contest. I am aware that Dr. Mehllase could not stand if I was late to Klasse again, but if I won, I could get a free trip to Berlin!"
